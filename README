# TwitchCancer

Suite of tool targeted at diagnosing, monitoring and recording data about chat cancer on Twitch.

These 4 components run independently from each other and communicate through ZeroMQ sockets and WebSockets. Any single one can be restarted or down, the others will reconnect when possible.

## Install

- python setup.py install
- edit your local config file (see Configuration)

### Configuration

You can use the `-f` or `--config` switch to pass the path of a configuration file overriding any of the [default settings](twitchcancer/config.default.yml).

The monitor module requires a valid Twitch username and an active oauth key, example:

```yaml
monitor:
    chat:
        username: username      # your twitch username
        password: oauth:key     # http://twitchapps.com/tmi/
```

You would then run the monitor module with:

`twitchcancer-monitor -f myconfig.yml`

## Monitor

### Goal

- join chat channels on Twitch (IRC or WebSocket)
- compute cancer points for each message based on a cancer diagnosis
- store these in-memory and publish reports every minute on a ZeroMQ socket

### Requirements

- IRC: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/irc
or
- Python >= 3.4 (asyncio)
- AutoBahn: http://autobahn.ws/python

- PyZMQ: https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq

### Usage

See `twitchcancer-monitor -h`

## Record

### Goal

- subscribe to the monitoring socket
- update persistent leaderboards with new data (MongoDB)

### Requirements

- PyMongo: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo
- PyZMQ: https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq

### Usage

See `twitchcancer-record -h`

## Expose

### Goal

- push live cancer status (every second) and leaderboards (every minute), Pub/Sub WebSocket API

### Usage

See `twitchcancer-expose -h`

- connect to: 'ws://localhost:8080'
- subscribe: `{'subscribe': 'topic'}'
- unsubscribe: `{'unsubscribe': 'topic'}'

### Requirements

- PyMongo: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pymongo
- PyZMQ: https://github.com/zeromq/pyzmq
